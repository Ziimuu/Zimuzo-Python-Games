A collection of Python games created to learn and master Python.
# Zimuzo's Python Game Collection

Welcome to my Python game collection! This repository showcases several games I created while learning Python programming. These projects demonstrate my understanding of core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and user input handling. Below is a brief overview of each game:

## Games

### 1. *Hangman Game*
A fun and interactive Hangman game with multiple categories to choose from:  
- *DC Characters*  
- *Marvel Characters*  
- *Nigerian Names*  

Players choose a category, and the game displays dashes for each letter of the word. You can guess letters, and if you're stuck, you can ask for a hint (at the cost of one chance). Hints reveal two random letters from the word. Be careful with your guesses, as each wrong guess decreases your chances! 

*Instructions:*  
- Run the main.py file to start playing.  
- Choose a category, then begin guessing letters.  
- You have 6 chances to guess the word correctly before the game ends.

### 2. *Snake Game*
A classic snake game where the objective is to eat the food and grow your snake without crashing into walls or the snake itself. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game keeps track of your score based on how many food items you've eaten. 

*Instructions:*  
- Run the main.py file to start playing.  
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.

### 3. *Rock Paper Scissors*
The classic rock-paper-scissors game. You can play against the computer, which randomly chooses its move. The game compares your choice with the computerâ€™s to determine the winner.

*Instructions:*  
- Run the main.py file to start playing.  
- Choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
